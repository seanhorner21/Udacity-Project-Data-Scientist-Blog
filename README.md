# Udacity-Project-Data-Scientist-Blog

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to completing the nanodegree for Udacity's Introduction to Data Science course. I used Stack Overflow's dataset of survey answers to 153 questions based ont heir careers as developers. These questions included demographic questions such as the country in which the respondent work and qualitative questions like current job satisfaction, enjoyment of problem solving and more.

## Installations

For this project I imported the programs numpy, pandas and matplot.lib

## Project Motivation

Fir this project, I thought about what is important in order for a develop to be successful. As someone who struggles with some of the skills that many seem to have as developers, I wanted to see how some of these affect salary and career satisfaction. The skills included problem solving, and enjoying learning new things. I used experience in the amount of years coded as a kind of control as I highly expected a steady increase in salary as experience increases.

# Conclusions

From our analysis we can conclude three things that lead to higher salaries and job satisfaction:

1. More years coded in job
2. Higher affinity for willingness to learn new technologies
3. More enjoyment for problem solving
