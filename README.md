# Udacity-Project-Data-Scientist-Blog

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to completing the nanodegree for Udacity's Introduction to Data Science course. I used Stack Overflow's dataset of survey answers to 153 questions based ont heir careers as developers. These questions included demographic questions such as the country in which the respondent work and qualitative questions like current job satisfaction, enjoyment of problem solving and more.

## Imports

For this project I imported the programs numpy, pandas and matplot.lib

# Conclusions

From our analysis we can conclude three things that lead to higher salaries and job satisfaction:

1. More years coded in job
2. Higher affinity for willingness to learn new technologies
3. More enjoyment for problem solving
